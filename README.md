# Challenge 2

## Project Description

I created a professional portfolio website using HTML and CSS for the second weekly challenge in the Columbia Coding Boot Camp. This will be updated over time with deployed applications as they are created, but includes placeholders currently. I applied concepts we learned in the course including flexboxes, media queries, CSS variables, responsive design, and more. I referenced materials from the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, W3 Schools, MDN Web Docs, StackOverflow, and CodePen while completing this project.
